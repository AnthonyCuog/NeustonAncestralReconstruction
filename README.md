# NeustonAncestralReconstruction

Here you may find the code and necessary documents to replicate our neustonic character trait reconstructions

Specific manuscript information will be updated once publication is released

The RAxML directory contains final RAxML outputs
The CharacterTraits directory holds .csv files with extant character traits to be mapped to phylogenies

Code contains step by step explanations for each step

PLEASE NOTE:
All directories will need to be changed locally.

Send a message if the analysis is not working for you.
